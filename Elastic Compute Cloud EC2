EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in AWS for running applications on Amazonâ€™s infrastructure.It allows users to rent virtual computers to run applications, with control over compute power, storage, and configuration. 
EC2 instances work by leveraging virtualization, running on a hypervisor that manages resources and isolates instances on physical hardware.
EC2 is a fundamental service in AWS that provides saclable computing capacity in the cloud.

Here are the key concepts & components you can use with in EC2:-
  1. Instance 
  2. Security
  3. Networking
  4. Storage
  5. Scaling
  6. Monitoring & Management 

1. Instances:
Instance Types: Understand the different instance types (e.g., T2, M5, C5) and their use cases.
Launching Instances: Learn how to launch and configure instances using the AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDKs.
AMI (Amazon Machine Images): Create, use, and manage AMIs for launching instances.

2.Security:
Security Groups: Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Key Pairs: Manage SSH key pairs for secure access to instances.
IAM Roles: Assign IAM roles to instances for secure access to AWS services.

3.Networking:
Elastic IPs: Allocate and associate Elastic IP addresses with instances.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Integration: Understand how EC2 instances work within a VPC, including subnetting, routing, and internet gateways.
ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces): Manage and attach ENIs to instances.

4.Storage:
EBS (Elastic Block Store): Create and manage EBS volumes, snapshots, and encryption.
Instance Store: Use and understand ephemeral storage provided by instance store.
EFS (Elastic File System): Mount EFS file systems to instances for shared storage.

5.Scaling:
Auto Scaling: Set up Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale instances based on demand.
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distribute traffic across multiple instances for high availability.

6.Monitoring and Management:
CloudWatch: Monitor instance performance, set alarms, and create dashboards.
Systems Manager: Use Systems Manager for automated patching, configuration, and management of instances.
CloudTrail: Track and audit API calls made to your EC2 instances.
